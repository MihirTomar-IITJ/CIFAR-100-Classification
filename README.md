# CIFAR-100-Classification
Implemented a CNN in Python (using Pytorch) to classify CIFAR100 images into classes ,superclass and groups as follows:

 • Plants/Parts of plants (Superclasses “flowers”, “trees”, “fruits and vegetables”)
 • Vehicles (Superclasses “vehicles1” and “vehicles2”)
 • Invertebrates (Superclasses “non-insect invertebrates” and “insects”)
 • Aquatic animals (Superclasses “fish” and “aquatic mammals”)
 • Large animals (Superclasses “large carnivores” and “large omnivores and herbivores”)
 • Man-made articles (Superclasses “food containers”, “household electrical devices”, “household furniture”, and “large man-made
 outdoor things”)
 • People (Superclass “people”)
 • Normal Terrestrial Animals (Superclass “reptiles”, “medium-sized mammals” and “small mammals”)
 • Outdoor scenes (Superclass “large natural outdoor scenes”)


 This is the nomenclature we are following for the taxonomy: CLASSES(100) → SUPERCLASSES(20) → GROUPS(9)
